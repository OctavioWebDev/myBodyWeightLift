        A dedicated front-end web developer and software engineer based in Toledo,
        Ohio. My journey into the world of technology and personal growth is
        deeply intertwined with my life's experiences.

      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6 text-white">
        Growing up on the eastside of Toledo, Ohio, I faced many challenges and changes. 
        My great-grandmother took custody of me when I was 2, and I was adopted at 9. 
        Though my great-grandmother and her boyfriend did their best to raise me, 
        I lacked a strong father figure in my life. By the age of 14, I was kicked out of
         the house due to my rebellious nature.
      </p>

      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6 text-white">
        At 19, I was living a life of debauchery and excess, but a significant 
        turning point came when I moved to Louisiana at 20. There, I met my future wife and her 
        daughter, who would eventually call me 'Dad'. Her calling me 'Dad' made me realize that my 
        life needed a drastic change to be worthy of such a role. I began to pray and seek guidance 
        from my Heavenly Father, asking Him to teach me how to be a man and a father.
      </p>

      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6 text-white">
        As I delved into the Word of God, my life started to transform. Now, 15 years later, I am 
        blessed with a wonderful marriage and nine children. Though I am far from perfect, I am thankful 
        for the changes God has made in my life.
      </p>

      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6 text-white">
        Professionally, I have over eight years of experience in logistics and warehouse management, 
        which I now leverage in my role as a software engineer. I specialize in front-end technologies 
        like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js, and I am passionate about creating solutions 
        that enhance operational efficiency and project management.

        This blog is an attempt to give something back to my children and future generations. 
        Itâ€™s about God and what He has done for me. Through my posts, I hope to share insights on web 
        development, personal growth, and the values of preparation, commitment, and responsibility. I am 
        also working on a lifestyle brand called Chi Rho Power and Strength, which embodies these principles.
